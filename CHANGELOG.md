# Wing Commander Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v0.2.0-beta.12] - 2018-09-10
### Added
- Application usage analytics collected via Google Analytics. Application usage analytics have been added to **Wing Commander** to assist with understanding "real-world" deployment usage and better focus the development of improvements and features. No personally identifiable information is collected (you can check the source code). Information that is collected includes the application version and the events that occur within the application (i.e. if you select 'start', 'update', etc.). Application usage analytics are enabled by default. If you wish to 'opt-out', please update your `config.toml` file with the following entries:
```
[WingCommander]
analyticsenabled = false
```

## [v0.2.0-beta.11] - 2018-09-07
### Added
- Added support for Telegram Inline Keyboards. **Wing Commander** will now display a **Main Menu** to the user at startup. The **Main Menu** is context aware, and will only display command button options that are considered valid based on the current state. For example, the `start` button will be shown if the Bot is not currently monitoring your Nodes and the `stop` button will be shown if it is.  The **Main Menu** will be shown automatically on start-up and at the completion of executing a command. Note that some commands are performed in the background and responces rely on feedback from remote systems. In these cases the menu may move up through the conversation as additional status information is reported by the Bot. Note that all the Bot commands remain accessable through the chat also - the menu does not replace them, it just provides a simpler way to access them.
- Added the `/menu` command. This allows the user to manually request the **Main Menu** to be shown.

## [v0.2.0-beta.10] - 2018-09-01
### Added
### Changed
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
- Fixed application instance control which was accidentally disabled in [v0.2.0-beta.9]. This has been reinstated and will again prevent multiple instances of the Bot from running on the same machine.
### Security

## [v0.2.0-beta.9] - 2018-08-31
### Added
- Added `/update` command. This will detect if a newer release is available on GitHub and if so, will invoke the `wc-update.sh` shell script to pull the latest source, build, install and then run the new version. Immediately after invoking the shell script, the current application instance will terminate. The new instance of the Bot will message you to tell you it has restarted as a result of an upgrade. If you do not get this message within a reasonable period of time (1-2min), you should investigate and manually start the Bot.
### Changed
- Change the `wc-update.sh` to improve its handling and management of the upgrade process. Only very minor changes, and this script can still be called directly from the command line.
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
### Security

## [v0.2.0-beta.8] - 2018-08-29
### Added
- Added (**Beta**) autoupdate shell script [scripts/wc-update.sh](https://github.com/BigOokie/skywire-wing-commander/blob/dev/scripts/wc-update.sh). This shell script was published recently on the project [wiki](https://github.com/BigOokie/skywire-wing-commander/wiki) to gain feedback from the community. Feedback at this point indicates the script is extreamly useful and as such has now been incorporated into the scripts provided by the project. Please refer to the [Autoupdate Script](https://github.com/BigOokie/skywire-wing-commander/wiki/Autoupdate-Script) page on the project wiki for more information.
- Added `/uptime` command. This dynamically generates a URL query for the Skywirenc.com site for the list of currently connected Nodes and presents a hyperlink button to the user. Clicking the hyperlink button will launch the users browser and take them to the Skywirenc.com site displaying the current uptime for the locally connected nodes.
### Changed
- Structure of the project now follows (wip) the pricipals outlines in [golang-standard - project-layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) and [Package Oriented Design](https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2017/02/package-oriented-design.html). This is a structural change to the physical layout of the project repository - so a large number of files have changed, moved or may no longer exist.
- Changed location of the following files:
    - `config.exampl.toml`. Can now be found in `cmd/wcbot/`.
    - `wcbuildconfig.sh`. Can now be found in `scripts/`.
    - `wcstart.sh`. Can now be found in `scripts/`.

## [v0.2.0-beta.7] - 2018-08-24
### Added
### Changed
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
- Fixed issue with Discovery Server checks. Wing Commander now correctly handles errors when performing checks against the Discovery Server, and will correctly report this to the user via Telegram. Connected Discovery Node count will be set to zero (0) in these instances.
### Security

## [v0.2.0-beta.6] - 2018-08-23
### Added
- Added application instance control to detect and prevent multiple instances of the Bot application from running on the same system. If another instance of the Bot is detected as already running on the local system, then the new instance will report a (fatal) error and refuse to start. Intructions are provided to the user on how to terminate the other instances (if this is required).
- Added command line flag `-help` which outputs application help to the command line.
- Added command line flag `-about` which outputs information about the application ot the command line.
### Changed
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
- Fixed potential concurrency race condition that could cause the Bot to crash.
### Security

## [v0.2.0-beta.5] - 2018-08-21
### Added
- Added command line flag `-v` to check Wing Commander version.
- Added command line flag `-config` to dump the Wing Commander configuration to the command line.
### Changed
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
- Fixed issue with `/showconfig` command. This command now sends the configuration information to Telegram in plain-text. Previously the message was being sent using markdown which appears to have caused issued on some systems (due to special characters in the configuration data).
### Security

## [v0.2.0-beta.4] - 2018-08-19
### Added
- Added `/checkupdate` command. Requests the Bot to check GitHub to determine if a new version is available. The Bot will report back its findings. Note: This command does not perform the upgrade.
### Changed
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
### Security

## [v0.2.0-beta.3] - 2018-08-18
### Added
- Added monitoring of the Skywire Discovery Server to ensure local Nodes are connected. The connection of all locally connected Nodes are now checked as part of the routine Heartbeat cycle. The Heartbeat status message will report both the number of locally connected Nodes (Nodes connected to the local Manager) as well as the number of these Nodes that are currently registered with the Discovery Server. This feature is intended to help the Skyfleet community preserve their Node up-times and remain elegible for monthly Testnet rewards.
- Added error reporting notifications to report when the Bot is unable to connect to the local manager. This error notification will be reported each time the local Manager Node is polled (default 10sec).
### Changed
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
### Security

## [v0.2.0-beta.2] - 2018-08-12
### Added
- Added autorestart shell script (`wcstart.sh`). Thanks to @Cryptovinnie
- Added config file generator shell script (`wcbuildconfig.sh`). Thanks to @Cryptovinnie
- Added `/showconfig` command. This will ask the Bot to display its current runtime configuration, as stored in the `config.toml` file.
- Added `/checkupdate` command. This allows the Bot to check for new releases on GitHub and report back the status.
### Changed
- `/status` command will now respond differently depending on if the Monitor is currently runing or not (i.e. `/start`). When the Monitor is not running, the responce will indicate this. When the Monitor is running, the responce will indicate the current number of connected Nodes.
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
### Security

## [v0.2.0-beta.1] - 2018-08-10
### Added
- Code tests.
- Added list of Contributors [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md)
- Added ability for Bot to compensate for missing `@` on `admin` user in `config.toml`. Previosuly is the admin user was not prefixed with an `@` the Bot would refuse to respond to messages from your user on Telegram. Now the Bot will compensate (the `config.toml` file is unchanged) by updating its runtime configuration to add the missing `@` if required. The Bot will log a warning to notify you.
### Changed
- Minor updates to messages generated from Wing Commander.
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
- Minor fixes to code and doco based on community feedback during ALPAH release stage.

## [v0.1.1-alpha.1] - 2018-08-03
### Added
### Changed
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
### Security
- Prevent the **Wing Commander** bot from responding to any user who is not configured as the Admin (in the `config.toml`). Messages or commander from non-admin users are simply dropped and ignored. Previously they could be processed - meaning any Telegram user could initiate a private chat with an instance of the **Wing Commander** bot that they do not own. This has now been resolved.  All users should upgrade to this version. v0.1.0-alpha.1 should not be used.

## [v0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2018-08-02
### Added
- TOML based configuration. A valid `config.toml` file is required in the users `$HOME/.wingcommander` folder. The `$HOME` folder may be different depending on your OS. An example reference configuration file is provided (`config.toml.example`).
- Added a formal changelog (based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)), and document version history.

### Changed
- Changed versioning. This project now adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Note that versions prior to this do not follow formal Semantic Versioning.
- Renamed application and project to Skywire-Wing-Commander (from skywire-telegram-notify-bot).
- Restructured repository layout (folders).
- Notifications for Node `connect` and `disconnect` events are sent via Telegram. Monitoring is initiated by the `/start` command, and terminated using the `/stop` command. Monitoring interval (seconds) is set within the `config.toml`. Each time a connect or disconnect notification is provided, the Bot will also provide a count of the number of Nodes currently connected to the Manager.
- The `/start` command now also initiates a heartbeat based on a configurable interval (`config.toml`).

### Deprecated
### Removed
- Support for commande line parameters. All runtime configuration must now be sourced from `config.toml`
- The `/heartbeat` command has been removed. A heartbeat is now managed by the `/start` command.
### Fixed
### Security

## [v0.0.3-alpha] - 2018-06-26
### Added
- Support for TravisCI
### Changed
- `Manager` connection status changes now provide a structured Telegram message. Previously a raw JSON dump was sent as the message.
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
- Pevent `Manager` connection monitor from running more than one instance.
### Security

## [v0.0.2-alpha] - 2018-06-24
### Added
- Support for Official Sky Miner (running the official OrangePi images). The Official Miner uses different file locations for `Manager` configuration files (when compared to DIY Miners). Specifically the app was monitoring for changes in the `clients.json` file.
- Telegram status notifications now include count of connections by type (and directions - incomming or outgoing).
### Changed
- Major refactor of code base to redesign approach.

### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
### Security

## [v0.0.1-alpha] - 2018-06-23
### Added
- Support `bottoken` command line parameter. Allows the Telegram API Key to be passed to the application. The application will refuse to start if this is not provided. The API Key will be provided by the Telegram `@BotFather`.
- Support `botdebug` command line parameter. Allows debugging of the Telegram Bot API interface to be enabled (off by default).
- Support for `Manager` connection status monitoring (via `clients.json` file) on SkyCoin Miners running the non-official DIY platforms (such as Raspberry Pi). Official Miners are not supported at this stage.
- Bot will send raw JSON dump of the `clients.json` file from the SkyMiner `Manager` when ever this file changes.
- Added `CREDITS.md` to record licencing and attribution for licenced and derivative works.
- Added Icon: `SKY_RANK_WingCommander.png` (not currently used). Credit Noun Project for derivative work.
- Added Icon: `WingCommanderLogo.png`. Credit SkyCoin project for derivative work.
